# Velero

Velero is a backup and restore tool for Kubernetes. It is used to backup the cluster's resources, and to restore them in case of disaster. It is also used to migrate the cluster to another provider.

Before using Velero, all you need is an external S3 bucket to store your backups. You can use any S3 compatible storage provider. 
When creating the cluster, all velero variables are to be set either manualy in the `terraform.tfvars` file or during the automatic setup, according to the type of installation you choose.

## Configuration

**Set persistent volumes backup**

We use the opt-in approach from Velero to backup persistent volumes (more information [here](https://velero.io/docs/main/file-system-backup/)). This means that you need to add the following annotation to your pods, when you want its PVC to be saved : `backup.velero.io/backup-volumes: <volumes_names>, ...`. This will backup the persistent volume claim and the persistent volume associated with it.

You can use the opt-out approach by setting `velero_default_volumes_to_fs_backup` to `true` in the `terraform.tfvars`.

## Velero's CLI

Velero comes with a CLI to manage the backups. You can install it [here](https://velero.io/docs/v1.6/basic-install/). To bind the CLI to your cluster, just set the `--kubeconfig` flag when you run a command. Otherwise, Velero will use your default kubeconfig file.

**Manual backup**

To backup the cluster, you need to create a backup file. This is done with the following command : `velero backup create BACKUP_NAME`. You can list your backups with `velero backup get`.

**Auto backup**

To schedule a backup of your namespace, just refer to the template `common/Schedlule-template.yaml.template` and fill it with the correct values. Then apply it with `kubectl apply -f Schedlule-template.yaml`.

**Restore from backup**

To restore from a backup, run the following command, with *BACKUP_NAME* being the name of the backup you want to restore from : `velero restore create --from-backup BACKUP_NAME`.
